## description

The application features an interactive 3D scene, the Aurasphere, rendered using the Threlte core library. 

My initial inspiration was thinking about how when people are experiencing an anxiety attack/panic attack or even just feeling a bit stressed and needing a breather, it could help to have an app to help ground them and reconnect them back to the present moment. It's an easy and friendly way to do a little breathing exercise and something to focus on in times of anxiety or stress! 

### features
- users can inhale and exhale in time with the movement of the planet for a calming experience.
- ambient sound can be toggled on and off by clicking on the planet.
- users can explore the rest of the scene which provides sensory visuals and animations.
- hover interactions and animations
